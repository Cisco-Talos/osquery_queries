  description: A filepath associated with a Crystalbit or Apple DLL hijack attempt was detected.
    During this attack, the threat actor leverages both Crystalbit and Apple applications
    as part of a dll double hijack attack chain that starts with a fraudulent software bundle
    and eventually leads to a persistent miner and in some cases spyware deployment.
