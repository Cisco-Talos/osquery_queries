A Kerberoast attack involves requesting Kerberos TGS service tickets with RC4 (encryption type 0x17), this is suspicious because Microsoft disabled its use in favor of AES. Since the service ticket was encrypted with the hash of the account linked to the requested SPN, the attacker can crack this encrypted data to obtain the account's password. \n",
