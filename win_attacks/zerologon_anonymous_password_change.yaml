  description: Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472) is a Windows vulnerability affecting its Netlogon feature. The vulnerability originates
    from a cryptographic flaw in the authentication scheme used by Netlogon's remote protocol. When successfully exploited,
    this allows attackers to impersonate any host in the targeted Active Directory organization, including the domain controller.

    set as ANONYMOUS LOGON with the PasswordLastSet attribute confirmed as a recent change to the account.
