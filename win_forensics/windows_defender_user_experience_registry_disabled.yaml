    Defender have been disabled, which could indicate malicious activity.

    - DisablePrivacyMode prevents users, who are not administrators, from seeing the
    threat history data, which lists the items that Windows Defender detected as threats
    on the device.

    - Notification_Supress, if disabled, stops notifications from Windows Defender
    from being displayed.

    - AllowNonAdminFunctionality, if enabled, allows users who are do not have administrator
    privileges, to modify the settings of Windows Defender.'
