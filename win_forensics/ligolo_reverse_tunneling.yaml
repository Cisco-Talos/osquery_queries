  description: Ligolo is a reverse tunneling tool targeted for use by penetration testers for establishing SOCKS5 and TCP tunnels from a reverse connection. This software is often used once testers have sucessfully compromised a host and wish to establish network connections to other systems in the same local area network (LAN). Threat actors have also been known to drop and utilize this tool to gain better control over compromised endpoints. The presence of active processes with the tool's default filename could be indicative of a compromised host or a malware infection.
