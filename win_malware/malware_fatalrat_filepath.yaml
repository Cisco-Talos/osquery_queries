malware_fatalrat_filepath:
  description: A filepath associated with FatalRAT was detected. It appears to be
    distributed through Telegram channels, forums and hidden in download links. Known
    samples are capable of performing defense evasion such as VM-identification and
    running AV-processes identification, obtaining system persistence, logging user
    keystrokes, collecting system information and exfiltrating over encrypted command
    and control (C&C) channel. Defghi.exe is dropped into %WINDOWS% and a new service
    is created based on it.
