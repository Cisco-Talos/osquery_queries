malware_tmanger_filepath:
  description: A filepath associated with Tmanger RAT was detected. Its manner of
    persistence depends on its elevation level. Under admin, it drops a DLL in SysWOW64
    satisfying the regex [a-z]{4}\.dll and creates a service based on it. Under non-admin,
    it drops a DLL into Temp directory and sets CurrentVersion\Run registry key to
    it. The dropped file contains encrypted C2 config data. The RAT is capable of
    launching processes, manipulating and exfiltrating files, screen capture and keylogging.
