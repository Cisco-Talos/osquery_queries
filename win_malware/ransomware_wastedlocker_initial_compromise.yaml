  description: WastedLocker is ransomware commonly activated by the adversary on several different systems within
    the same targeted corporate network. It is dropped to the host through a series of privilege
    escalation and lateral movement. The initial compromise involves a fake Google Chrome web browser
    update delivered as a drive-by download from a compromised website.
