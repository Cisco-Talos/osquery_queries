  description: The CRAT malware family consists of multiple RAT capabilities, additional
    plugins and a variety of detection-evasion techniques. Linked attacks consists of a
    highly modular malware that can function as a standalone RAT and  download and activate
    additional malicious plugins from its C2 servers. The core module is often injected
    and reflected into process memory address space by a PE loader. The loader will establish
    persistence on the infected host before executing code for anti-analysis checks.
