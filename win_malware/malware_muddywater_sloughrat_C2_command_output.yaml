  description: MuddyWater is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) recently attributed to
    the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) by the U.S. Cyber Command.
    Multiple attack and infection chains have recently been used by this APT group,
    utilizing malicious PDFs, XLS files, and Windows executables. A later stage in their
    attack chain leverages a WSF-based RAT entitled SloughRAT. This query looks for a
    file name used to store command output from commands issued to hosts infected by
    SloughRAT, via the C2 server.
