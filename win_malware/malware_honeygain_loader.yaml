malware_honeygain_loader:
  description: Honeygain is proxyware allowing users to install a client and offer
    their unused Internet service bandwidth in exchange for monetary compensation.
    Attackers leverage proxyware like Honeygain for their monetization efforts. Once
    access is gained to a host, they will install and configure the Honeygain client
    to use their own accounts. This results in unwanted resource consumption and strongly
    indicates compromise of the host itself.
