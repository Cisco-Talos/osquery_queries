  description: A mutex associated with Nephilim was detected. Nephilim, also called
    Nefilim, is a ransomware used in targeted attacks, particularly against oil and
    energy companies. It is usually delivered via vulnerable RDP services. The encryption
    is done with a combination of AES-128 for the files and RSA-2048 to encrypt the
    AES key. After infection, encrypted files are given the .NEFILIM or .NEPHILIM
    extension.
