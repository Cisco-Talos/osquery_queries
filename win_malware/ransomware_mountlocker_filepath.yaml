  description: A filepath associated with Mount Locker was detected. Mount Locker
    is a ransomware that began breaching corporate networks and demanding high ransom
    payments since, at least, July 2020. Aside from encrypting files on the infected
    systems, Mount Locker also steals unencrypted files and threatens victims with
    publishing them if the ransom is not paid. Mount Locker uses ChaCha20 to encrypt
    the files and RSA-2048 to encrypt the key.
