malware_honeygain_bot:
  description: Honeygain is proxyware allowing users to install a client and offer
    their unused Internet service bandwidth in exchange for monetary compensation.
    Attackers leverage Honeygain using multiple accounts for their monetization efforts
    via a proxyware botnet. Once access is gained to a host, they will install and
    configure the Honeygain client to use their own accounts. This results in unwanted
    resource consumption and strongly indicates compromise of the host itself.
