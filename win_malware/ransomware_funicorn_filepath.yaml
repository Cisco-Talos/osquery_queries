  description: A filepath associated with FuckUnicorn ransomware was detected. FuckUnicorn
    has been targeting computers in Italy by tricking victims into downloading a fake
    contact tracing app, named Immuni, that promises to provide real-time updates
    for the COVID-19 outbreak. Upon executing the malware it displays a fake Coronavirus
    Map from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.
    The ransomware adds the .fuckunicornhtrhrtjrjy extensions to names of encrypted
    files.
