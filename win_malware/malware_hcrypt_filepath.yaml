  description: "A file path associated with HCrypt was created. HCrypt is a multistage\
    \ and fileless \ncrypter-as-a-service used to distribute Remote Access Trojans\
    \ (RATs). \nRecent campaigns host malware in public hosting services . The first\
    \ stage is \ndelivered via phishing emails with attachments that usually contain\
    \ an obfuscated \nVBScript file that downloads the next stage of the infection.\
    \ The final stage of \nthe attack is a PowerShell script with embedded payloads\
    \ that are later injected \ninto legitimate processes."
