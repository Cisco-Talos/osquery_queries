  description: A Windows Registry run key associated with the Crimson RAT malware
    was created. Crimson RAT is a remote access trojan known to be used by the APT
    called Transparent Tribe (also known as Mythic Leopard and APT36). The Crimson
    RAT process achieves persistence by creating a new Registry run key with the value
    pointing to its own file path which will cause the process to be automatically
    executed when a user logs in. Crimson RAT provides multiple features including
    process list, take screenshots, exfiltrate files, list files and directories,
    kill processes, and execute remote files.
