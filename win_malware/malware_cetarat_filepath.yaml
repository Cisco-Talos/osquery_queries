  description: A file path known to be associated with CetaRAT was created on the system. 
    CetaRAT is a remote access trojan used in campaigns often attributed to the APT actor 
    called SideCopy. It first arrives to a system via malicious Microsoft Office documents 
    with embedded macros that download a payload to the Startup folder of an infected system 
    to establish persistence. CetaRAT has many dangerous capabilities, such as: collecting 
    information about the victim's machine, downloading and executing other malicious files, 
    deleting registry keys and directories, taking screenshots and modifying or exfiltrating 
    clipboard data.
