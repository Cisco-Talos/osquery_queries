  description: Gamaredon is an APT that has been active since at least 2013. It uses
    trojanized application installers, self-extracting archives with common names
    and icons and spam emails with malicious payloads. For the first stage of infection
    Gamaredon uses either a Windows Batch file and/or Visual Basic Scripting (VBS).
    Some Gamaredon campaigns use template injection in Word documents as an initial
    attack vector, which is usually delivered via a spear phishing email.
