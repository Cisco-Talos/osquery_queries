  description: Chthonic is a Remote Access Tool (RAT) that has evolved from Zeus.
    It may be delivered either through the Andromeda botnet or by phishing emails
    containing a malicious document as part of a targeted attack. Once executed, the
    main loader begins downloading additional components to expand its arsenal. Modules
    include capabilities to collect system information, steal passwords, keylogging
    and video capture from the webcam or screen. Chthonic is primarily aimed at stealing
    credentials for online banking, targeting over 150 banks and twenty payment systems
    across fifteen countries. The primary targets include the UK, Spain, the US, Russia
    and Japan.
