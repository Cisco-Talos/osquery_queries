malware_honeygain_trojanized_installer:
  description: Honeygain is proxyware allowing users to install a client and offer
    their unused Internet service bandwidth in exchange for monetary compensation.
    In some cases, the setup utility used to install the client is modified and embedded
    with additional unwanted software or malware. This results in unexpected software
    or possibly compromised hosts in the case of embedded malware, assuming such proxyware
    is allowed on the network.
