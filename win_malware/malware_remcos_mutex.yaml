  description: A mutex is typically used for synchronization in Windows, which can be useful for 
    coordinating access to shared resources. Malware will often use a crafted mutex to determine
    if it is already executing, preventing it from reinfecting an already infected system. A
    mutex known to be associated with Remcos is present on the system. Remcos is a Remote Access
    Tool (RAT) with features which include but are not limited to key-logging, screen capture,
    webcam and microphone recording.
