  description: CollectionRAT consists of an MFC based Windows application that contains implanted 
    malicious code which is decrypted, and executed instead of the original application. 
    CollectionRAT functions as a remote access tool that provides full access to the file 
    system and the ability to execute arbitrary commands, and process on the system. 
    As part of its initialization routine, CollectionRAT creates a unique mutex in 
    order to prevent multiple copies of it self from running on the system simultaneously.
