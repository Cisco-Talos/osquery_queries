  description: Cring is a .NET ransomware binary using AES to encrypt files with select
    archive format or Microsoft Office file extensions. The AES key is encrypted with
    an included 8192-bit RSA public key. Attempted service and process termination
    prior to file encryption is performed for select backup and database solutions.
    The ransomware binary itself will not proceed with normal operations unless given
    the single argument "cc" during runtime.
