  description: Buran is a ransomware that started targeting government agencies, educational
    institutionsand health-care providers since 2018. It spreads primarily via phishing
    emails that contain documents with macros. Some variants have also been seen spreading
    through malicious advertisements. Newer variants of Buran are known as Zeppelin
    due to their use of the word "zeppelin" for the file extension and the autorun
    registry key that it creates to achieve persistence.
