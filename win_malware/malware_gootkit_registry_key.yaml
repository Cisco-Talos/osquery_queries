  description: 'Gootkit is a banking trojan that has been active since 2014 and uses
    the Node.JS library to carry out tasks such as: email parsing, web injection,
    video recording, taking screenshots, stealing passwords, etc. Gootkit is usually
    delivered via malicious emails. To achieve persistence, Gootkit drops an INF file
    and then creates three values under a GroupPolicy registry key.'
