Ryuk is a ransomware known for targeting large organizations and asking for rather large ransom payments to recover the encrypted files. The infection has been associated with emails that contain malicious attachments that first deliver Emotet, which is used to deliver modular payloads such as Ryuk. To achieve persistence, Ryuk adds a registry key to execute itself at every login.\n",
