  description: A mutex is typically used for synchronization in Windows, which can
    be useful for coordinating access to shared resources. Malware will often use
    a crafted mutex to determine if it is already executing, preventing it from reinfecting
    an already infected system. A mutex known to be associated with VenomRAT was seen
    being created on the system. VenomRAT is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) designed
    to remotely monitor and control an infected machine.
