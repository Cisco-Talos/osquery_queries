  description: RA Group's ransomware is known for using the leaked Babuk source code to attack 
  different businesses, including manufacturing companies, insurance providers and pharmaceuticals. RA 
  employs an approach known as double extortion, which involves exfiltrating files and data, before 
  they are encrypted, and threaten the victim with publishing it if they refuse to pay. Unlike other 
  families, the RA Group creates a ransom note specifically written with the name of each victim. RA 
  Group appends the 'GAGUP' extension to the files it encrypts.
