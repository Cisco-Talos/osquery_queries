  description: "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Apache's Log4j2 logging\
    \ library versions 2.0-beta9 through 2.12.1 and 2.13.0 through 2.15.0, and could\
    \ allow an attacker to get a specially crafted string processed by Log4j and use\
    \ it to execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers. This vulnerability was\
    \ assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2021-44228. The query helps to determine if\
    \ a host is vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228 by checking the if the system has a vulnerable\
    \ version of Log4j2 installed in one of the deb packages. "
