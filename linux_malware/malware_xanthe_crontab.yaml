  description: A cron job associated with Xanthe was detected. Xanthe is a multi-modular
    botnet that drops a payload to mine Monero cryptocurrency and employs various
    methods to spread across networks, mainly harvesting client-side certificates
    to gain access to known hosts using ssh or taking advantage of systems with an
    incorrectly configured Docker API.
